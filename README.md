## About Myself
I, Nisarg Rajendrakumar Patel, graduated from Gujarat Technological University in Gujarat, India, with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I joined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) after graduating in order to obtain some experience in the working world. For 3.5 years, I have been a full-stack web developer with TCS. I then made the decision to branch out further into another area of computer science and am currently pursuing a master's in software engineering (MSSE).

I code in Java, PHP, Drupal, C, C++, and C++. HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and React JS are all web technologies that I can use well. I wish to see myself in the position of Solution Architect in the Software Development industry in the coming few years.

## Things I Want to Get Out From This Course
I'm eager to learn about modern web architecture and software architecture since I want to see myself in the industry as a Solution Architect. I was surprised to see how everything came together when creating the web architecture when I was working with TCS. I'm particularly interested in finding out more about modern web architecture and new technologies.
