  <h1>Hello, I am Nisarg!</h1>
  <p>
    I, Nisarg Rajendrakumar Patel, graduated from Gujarat Technological University in Gujarat, India, with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I joined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) after graduating in order to obtain some experience in the working world. For 3.5 years, I have been a full-stack web developer with TCS. I then made the decision to branch out further into another area of computer science and am currently pursuing a master's in software engineering (MSSE).
